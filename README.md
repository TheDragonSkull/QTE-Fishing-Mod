ðŸ“– About:

This mod makes fishing more challenging by adding configurable Quick Time Events.

---

ðŸŽ® How it works:

When you catch something while fishing, a Quick Time Event (QTE) sequence will begin.
You must press the correct key/word shown on the screen before the timer runs out.
Each successful input will trigger a new key/word to press, and you must complete a full sequence (default: 4 correct keys/words) to catch the item.

If you press the wrong key or run out of time, the fish escapes, and your rod takes minor damage.
If you succeed, the loot is pulled toward you and you gain experience â€” just like in regular fishing, but more exciting!

Everything is configurable:

* The keys used for QTEs (default: A-Z, 0-9)
* How many successful keys are needed
* How much time you have per input
* Toggle Hard Mode
* The words used for the hard mode QTEs

This mod supports multiplayer.

 If you find bugs please report so I can try to fix them.
